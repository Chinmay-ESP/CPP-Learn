# C++ Matrix Programs

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs focused on **2D matrix operations**. These programs are ideal for learners who have understood 1D arrays and are ready to explore multi-dimensional data structures. Each program tackles a specific matrix manipulation task, building strong logic and problem-solving skills in C++.

## 📁 Contents

Below is the list of matrix-related programs included in this repository:

1. **Add Two Matrices**  
   Takes two matrices as input and adds corresponding elements to produce a resulting matrix.

2. **Check Whether Two Matrices Are Equal or Not**  
   Compares two matrices element-by-element to check if they are identical.

3. **Compute the Sum of Diagonals of a Matrix**  
   Calculates the sum of the primary and (if applicable) secondary diagonals of a square matrix.

4. **Print Boundary Elements of a Matrix**  
   Extracts and prints only the elements located on the boundary (edges) of the matrix.

5. **Find the Transpose of a Matrix**  
   Converts the matrix such that rows become columns and vice versa.

6. **Find the Determinant of a Matrix**  
   Computes the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 square matrix.

7. **Find the Normal and Trace of Matrix**  
   - *Normal*: Computes the Frobenius norm (square root of sum of squares of all elements).  
   - *Trace*: Adds elements on the main diagonal of a square matrix.

8. **Multiply Two Matrices**  
   Multiplies two compatible matrices using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

9. **Rotate Matrix Elements of a Matrix**  
   Rotates the entire matrix (usually by 90 degrees clockwise) to produce a new arrangement.

10. **Interchange Elements of First and Last Rows in Matrix**  
    Swaps the first and last rows of the matrix.

11. **Prefix Sum of Matrix**  
    Creates a new matrix where each element stores the sum of all elements from the top-left to the current cell, allowing quick submatrix sum queries.
