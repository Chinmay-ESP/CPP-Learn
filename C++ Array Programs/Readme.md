# C++ Array Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C++ programs that demonstrate various operations and manipulations on arrays. These programs are essential for understanding how arrays work in C++, including initialization, traversal, searching, and modifying array elements.

## üìÅ Contents

Below is the list of array-based programs included in this repository:

1. **Check if Two Arrays Are Equal or Not**  
   Compares two arrays element by element to check if they are equal.

2. **Maximum and Minimum in an Array**  
   Finds the largest and smallest elements in a given array.

3. **Calculate the Average of all the Elements Present in an Array**  
   Computes the average (mean) value of all elements in the array.

4. **Merge Two Arrays**  
   Combines two arrays into a single array in the same order.

5. **Print a 2D Array**  
   Displays a matrix-style array using nested loops.

6. **Find Common Array Elements**  
   Identifies and prints elements that are common between two arrays.

7. **Remove Duplicate Elements From an Array**  
   Eliminates duplicate values so that each element appears only once.

8. **Remove All Occurrences of an Element in an Array**  
   Deletes every instance of a specified value from the array.

9. **Prefix Sum Array**  
   Creates a prefix sum array where each element is the sum of all previous elements including itself.

10. **Rotate the Array D Times**  
    Rotates the elements of the array to the left by D positions.

11. **Copy All the Elements of One Array to Another in the Reverse Order**  
    Copies all elements from one array to another, but in reverse order.
