# üßÆ C++ Function Programs

This repository contains C++ programs that demonstrate the power and flexibility of **functions**, including recursion and modular code design. These examples build on your understanding of loops and conditionals and show how to make code more reusable and organized.

## üìÅ Contents

Below is the list of function-based C++ programs included in this repository:

1. **Display Prime Numbers Between Two Intervals Using Function**  
   Uses a function to find and display all prime numbers between two given numbers.

2. **Check Whether a Number Can be Expressed as Sum of Two Prime Numbers**  
   Implements logic to verify if a number can be split into two prime addends.

3. **Find the Sum of Natural Numbers using Recursion**  
   Uses a recursive function to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

4. **Calculate the Factorial of a Number Using Recursion**  
   Computes the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

5. **Reverse a Sentence Using Recursion**  
   Takes a string and reverses it using recursion instead of loops.

6. **Calculate Power Using Recursion**  
   Calculates the power of a number (`base^exponent`) using recursive multiplication.
